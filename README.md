Here is a map I made of great food spots in Animal Kingdom, and how to get from one to the other! 
As somone who used to work in Animal Kingdom, I would get asked often what the best places for food was and how they related to eachother distance wise. 
This map was created using Google Maps to create the route, GeoJSON to do some minor tweaking, leaflet for map creation, and mostly coding in Java Script in an HTML file. 
This was created as a project for Appalachian States We Mapping course, GHY 4818
